		<p id="status">This is it. The night of the biggest debate in the history of presidental politics. You stride out from the wings of the stage to what sounds like thunderous applause. Your opponent, the Councilman, is already behind his podium, watching you move across the floor, showing no trace of emotion. As you take your spot behind the podium, you feel confident yet nervous. You work on projecting an noticeable air of leadership by shuffling your notepad and straightening your lapels, and then you catch the gaze of your opponent for but a moment and he locks eyes with you.<br><br>
		Deliberately, he raises his hand and slowly draws one finger across his throat, never once breaking eye contact. You match his gaze and slowly rock your head from side to side, cracking your neck as the room falls silent. Both of you turn to face the moderator.<br><br>
		Looks like it's gonna be a good debate.</p>
	</section>
	<section id="moderator">
		<p id="round">The moderator tosses a coin in the air and then looks at you. 'Senator, the coin has spoken. You will have the first answer for all of our debate questions. Then, the esteemed Councilman will have a chance to respond. Normally, we'd allow you a chance to counter-counter-respond, but what with the national budget shortfall, we had to cut that portion of the debate from tonight's proceedings.'<br><br>
	  The moderator looks at you expectantly, along with an unending sea of faces behind him. 'Senator, are you ready to begin?'</p>
