## What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

This challenge reinforced the concept of padding, borders, and margins through repeated usage, and helped further my understanding of their specific purposes. Padding is used to create space directly around the element, and margins are used to create space outside of the element. The border marks the division between the padding and margin. I also learned that arithmetic is very important! To correctly space buttons, such as in a nav bar, you have to keep track of your paddings, borders, and margins to get the total width of a series of elements, and plan accordingly.

## What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I learned that using absolute positioning is necessary to get some elements to display correctly. Using positioning can justify an element to a specific position, allowing for other elements to display inline alongside it.

## What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to get my footer to display correctly. I wanted to put some text on the left side, and an unordered list of icons on the right. I was having a difficult time getting both elements to display inline with each other. The solution I came up with was to divide the footer into two equal divs, and then use absolute positioning to anchor one while I used the float property to keep the rightmost one in place. This took a lot of trial and error using the Dev Tools but ultimately created a better understanding of how to create a column layout.

## What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned that the Dev Tools are incredibly powerful for making adjustments or learning how properties can behave. After creating a rough pass at my CSS file, I could look at the page for errors or problem errors and tweak the CSS in the page before saving additional changes. It made the iteration process much faster and also taught me a few things about how neighboring elements interact with each other. I learned a few tricks about how to keep elements centered in the page regardless of the browser size, and also how to use CSS to evenly space elements in a list.

There were also some weird tricks I learned, such as whitespace in the HTML file translating into inherent padding between elements. I learned that closing the list tag isn't 100% necessary and eliminating it also reduces the whitespace in the CSS. That kind of interaction was not very intuitive and would not have been a solution I would have come across on my own.
