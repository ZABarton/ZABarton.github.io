How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

Working with a pair in this exercise was helpful! The wireframing process allows for a lot of creativity and it was fun to bounce ideas off of each other when laying out the original wireframing. We had no trouble collaborating on the HTML portion as well, and we were able to check each other's work and ask questions if one of us got stuck.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Yes! It let us develop a clear path forward when laying out the blog posts. We realized early on that the most important part of any blog post is the post text itself, so we started with that and built a wireframe around the central element.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

We went with a straightforward and simple approach. We started with the main content - the blog post itself - and built the rest of the wireframe around that. We retained the original information you would expect to see from the home page, including a site navigation element. We also included a second navigation bar for the blog posts so that the user could navigate between posts without having to back out and click through the menu.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)? 

I had already completed the solo challenge at this point, so we did not introduce any new semantic elements that I already hadn't seen. However, we did experiment with using multiple nav elements as well as multiple sections. I'm not sure exactly what the implications are for these but I expect to learn them firsthand as we move into CSS next week.
