			<h3><span class="post_title">Designing For Accessibility</span></h3>
			<h4><span class="date">Sunday, January 24, 2016</span></h4>
			<p>One of the most important things to consider when designing a website is that it will be published on a global scale, where anyone with access to the internet can view it. This means that a good website should be designed so that it is inclusive to as many people that can read it, regardless of any disabilities they may have.</p>
			<p>It is important to consider multiple perspectives from others when designing a site. Whether these differences come in the form of sensory disabilities, such as blindness or deafness, or in other forms such as poor motor control or reduced cognitive disabilities, or even slow and outdated internet connection speeds, a well-designed site should function equally for everyone. Thankfully, there are standards in place to make this happen. Just like the Americans with Disabilities Act givces us guidelines to make buildings and infrastructure physically accessible to everyone equally, we have the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/">Web Accessibility Initiative</a> to give us guidelines on how to design sites visually accessible to everyone equally.</p>
			<p>Some examples of designing for accessibility include the following:</p>
			<h5>Alt Text</h5>
			<p>For people who cannot visually see or process images, alt(erntative) text is an option that can describe the image. People who cannot see have an option to use a screen reader to translate the content of a webpage to audio form. In the case of images, the alt text is read to supply information about the image. Alt text also serves as a quicker way to display the content of an image for anyone with a low internet bandwidth or older hardware.</p>
			<h5>Mouse vs Keyboard</h5>
			<p>People who have reduced motor control, such as the elderly, may have issues using a mouse to navigate through a page. Therefore, any well-designed website should be able to be navigated using the keyboard alone. This also provides a benefit to people who cannot use a keyboard, as there are assistive technologies which can replace the function of a keyboard for those with zero motor control.</p>
			<h5>Audio and Video Transcripts</h5>
			<p>As the web increasingly moves towards video and audio content, some of this content is lost for people with hearing and/or vision loss, and also for people with little to no internet bandwidth or spotty internet connections. For these reasons, text transcripts of this content should be available so the information contained is not excluded from anybody.</p>
			<p>These standards are always in development, and are always improving along with technology. Luckily, there are many guides available which can teach designers how to make their sites more accessible.</p>
