      Hello! My name is Zach Barton, and here I'll be blogging about my Phase 0 experiences at Dev Bootcamp! Currently, I'm just about at the end of Week 1, where we've covered some fundamental concepts to maintaining a clean working environment. Specifically, we've learned how to use version control, git, and GitHub to maintain, store, and keep track of changes to code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Version control is a fundamental concept regardless of whether you are working on a small solo coding project or as part of a collaborative effort with a large team. Simply put, version control is how you ensure that everyone involved in the project is working on the same code and that no one member's contributions overwrite or eliminate the contributions of another.<br>
      If you've ever received an email with an attachment named something along the lines of "Draft Report - Final Version - Changes 12/5/15_DRAFT (Final)" then you might understand how useful version control can be. When multiple users are editing a single file, it becomes difficult to know who has the latest copy of the file, or who changed it last. Changes made between yesterday and two weeks ago may become impossible to compare. Version control does away with all of these problems. By retaining a master copy of the file in a safe location, other users can make copies of it and return their edited versions to this central location, providing a record of accountability for which changes belong to which user, and the order in which they were submitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      How do developers maintain version control for their own projects? One answer is by using git on their local machine. git is a method of tracking changes and creating "save points" in your code that can be easily recalled or reverted to in the future. git can help programmers keep track of their changes by staging files into several different categories: new files that are not yet being tracked, files that have been modified but not yet saved, and committed files - those which the changes have been officially saved. Once a file has been created, modified, and committed, a log report is automatically generated, complete with a unique ID and a message from the developer summarizing the changes. This log report is always available so regardless of how long the project continues, it is always possible to look up changes made much earlier in the project lifespan.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the developer is ready to move their code off of their local machine to the internet to share with other programmers and developers, a popular solution is to post the code into a repository on GitHub. GitHub functions in the same way as git, but exists as a remote solution in the cloud - meaning any person with access to the internet can also access GitHub. GitHub also maintains version control by retaining a master repository and a record of accountability when new code is merged into that master codebase. However, the additional benefit to storing code on GitHub is that other programmers can access and add to your code. When it comes to collaborating on large-scale projects, the additional help you can gain from other programmers with different perspectives is invaluable.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of these fundamental concepts will be necessary to work together with other Dev Bootcamp students, as we share feedback and code, and learn from each other in the process!
